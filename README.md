## Hi 👋

I'm Tommaso Trotto, a PhD Candidate in the Integrated Remote Sensing Studio at The University of British Columbia. My main focus is on ✨ lidar and satellite ✨ applications to study changes in the forest resilience associated with non-stand replacing disturbances. 

I started to develop tools for faster raster data processing, and hoping to start working on lidar data manipulation soon! My primary programming languages are Python and Rust

#### 🔭 My current project
- [rusterize](https://github.com/ttrotto/rusterize): a Python tool built in Rust for fast polygon rasterization (geopandas to xarray)

#### 📚 My research
Check out my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tommaso-Trotto?ev=hdr_xprf) profile!

Feel free to reach out if you have suggestions for improvements or collaborations 🙂
